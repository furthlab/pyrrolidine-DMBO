## 🧪 Summary

This repository contains the complete dataset, analysis scripts, and chemical structure files supporting our manuscript on the synthesis and evaluation of a pyrrolidine-fused dibenzocyclooctyne (DMBO) derivative. Contrary to predictions from computational chemistry, our results show that while azide reactivity is retained, the compound does **not** react with tetrazines—challenging existing models for dual click reactivity.
